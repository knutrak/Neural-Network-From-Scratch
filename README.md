Neural Network From Scratch

This project demonstrates the implementation of a neural network from scratch using only NumPy.
The work covers the fundamentals of neural networks, including forward propagation, backpropagation, weight updates, and experimentation on both binary classification and image classification datasets.

It also includes gradient checking to verify correctness of the backpropagation implementation and a comparison with PyTorch for benchmarking.
